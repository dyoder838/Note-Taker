## Description
This application is an exercise in node.js, and npm express. Node and Express are used to create an app that that can record, save, and delete user notes to a json database. This app employs a front and backend that are hosted on Heroku. The link to the deployed app is in the usage section. 

For this project, the frontend was provided by instructors; My task was to create the backend and connect it to the frontend.  

My work can be found in apiRoutes.js, htmlRoutes.js, server.js, and readme.

I provide detailed comments in the apiRoutes.js file

## Installation
If you want to use my work and keep building.
Clone the Repo.
This app requires NODE.js to run - install that first.
In the command terminal type: npm install.
To run the server, type nodemon in the command terminal. 
Then open a browser and type in localhost:3000.

You can also deploy your own version to heroku.

If you want to try the deployed app, the link is below in the usage section.

## Usage 

Click the link below to go to the deployed app.    
Type notes, push the save button. Your notes are saved forever - for any user to see - until a user pushes the delete button. The next person to visit the site will see what you wrote unless you delete it. Please be kind.
